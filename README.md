# ClayBrook Zoo Digital Project

## Welcome to Innovation at ClayBrook Zoo
Hello, I’m Ryan, an AI and Data Science student at the University of Northampton and president of the AI Society. This repository houses the ClayBrook Zoo Digital Project, designed to emulate a real business challenge for our academic course.

## Project Essence
Our academic project focuses on designing technological solutions for ClayBrook Zoo. We aim to demonstrate how digital innovations could potentially transform the zoo.

## Project Pillars
- **Digital Records Transformation**: Developing a digital system to modernize and enhance the zoo's data management.
- **Interactive Online Platform**: Crafting a digital portal to connect with visitors, integrating educational content and user-friendly services.
- **Kiosk Interface Design**: Creating mockups for an interactive kiosk to improve visitor experience through on-demand information and services.

## Objectives
- **Enhance Visitor Engagement**: Crafting interfaces that captivate and engage zoo visitors of all ages.
- **Simplify Operations**: Proposing digital solutions that could streamline zoo operations and enable more informed decision-making.
- **Educate and Conserve**: Designing platforms with the goal of promoting conservation and biodiversity through education.

## Development Approach
We adopted a structured approach to our project, conducting stakeholder interviews and competitor analysis, then moving to design mockups – all reflective of a typical digital strategy process.

## Progress and Involvement
- We designed mockups and requirements, basing them on real stakeholder needs.
- We presented these mockups to a mock client, simulating the feedback loop typical in software development.
